    <h1>JavaScript Data Types</h1>
    <h3>
        Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:
undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"<br>
Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"<br>
Number : typeof instance === "number"<br>
String : typeof instance === "string"<br>
BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint"<br>
Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol"<br>
null : typeof instance === "object".<br> Special primitive type having additional usage for it's value: if object is not inherited, then null is shown;<br>
Object : typeof instance === "object".<br> Special non-data but structural type for any constructed object instance also used as data structures: new Object, new Array, new Map, new Set, new WeakMap, new WeakSet, new Date and almost everything made with new keyword;<br>
Function non data structure, though it also answers for typeof operator: typeof instance === "function". <br>This answer is done as a special shorthand for Functions, though every Function constructor is derived from Object constructor

           //JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
            
           var length = 16;                               // Number :- Number can be float or integers
            var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String :- Strings takes the characters
            var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object :- Objects consists of more than one value of the variable

            //boolean :- Boolean consists of two value,either true or false
            var a = 5;
            var b = 5;
            var c = 6;
            (x == y)       // Returns true
            (x == z)       // Returns false 

            //Array :- Array consists of more than one value. It consists of list of similar values. 
            var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];    

            //undefined :- Undefined variables does not contain any value during decalaration. User can declare any value to it in between the program.
            var car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined 

            //Empty Values 
            var ca = "";    // The value is "", the typeof is "string"

            //Null
            var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
            person = null;    // Now value is null, but type is still an object
